          When I think of the internet, I dream of a place I cannot recognize
          today. In my mind, the internet is something entirely divorced from
          the reality it embodies today. To me, the internet is what it could
          have been, what people had hoped it would be at its inception.
        </p>
        <p>
          When the internet entered society, it promised a space for connection
          and expression that wasn't limited by the physical world. It was 'the
          new frontier' at the turn of the century. The web was the new 'big
          bang' of the design world. There were those who saw it as purely
          function (Prof. Dr Style), those who wanted to push the boundaries of
          what the web could be, and then those who saw paths to profit (dot com
          bubble).
        </p>
        <p>
          While I wasn't born early enough to experience a time when I might be
          truly overjoyed to
          <a
            href="#"
            class="audio"
            onclick="event.preventDefault(); new Audio('assets/youve-got-mail-sound.mp3').play(); youveGotMail();"
            >hear the sound of a notification</a
          >, it is a reality that I one day hope to experience. I imagine that
          it must have felt sci-fi in nature to experience that for the first
          time, being able to receive mail through the computer, from a stranger
          that you never really had to meet.

          In my mind, the internet is a place where individuals can run into
          each other, discover one another, and be exposed to the individuals
          behind the screens. In my mind, the internet is the means rather than
          the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the beginning, I feel like this was what it was.
          <a href="#" id="myspace">MySpace</a> had people learning HTML and CSS
          to make their websites. <a href="#" id="geocities">GeoCities</a> had
          people hosting their own websites from scratch. The early web was full
          of things that were extremely flawed, some ugly, some beautiful, but
          all were exploring what the internet could be.

      <section id="scene2" style="margin-bottom: 400px">
        <p>
          But as time's passed, it feels like that's creativity has withered in
          favor of consistency. There's been an uptick of 'template sites',
          where sites begin to look like one another, even if they were
          developed in isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sites like awwwards.com and siteinspire.com tend to feature sites that
          <a href="#" id="generic">feel the same.</a>

          and so I wonder, what would it take to make the web feel like itself
          again?
