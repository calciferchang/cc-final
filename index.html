        The dynamics of social media have been on my mind a lot recently. On one
        hand, it's really impressive to me from a technological standpoint: in
        the last thirty years, we've been able to be exposed to other people and
        other cultures in a way previously unthinkable. I have friends today and
        have had experiences that simply wouldn't have been possible twenty
        years ago. But on the other hand, it's caused irreparable harm and
        change to people. The amount we're connected to one another is what
        makes this such a problem: the human brain was never meant to process
        this amount of information. In the same way we cannot comprehend a
        billionaire's wealth, we cannot comprehend the amount of complicated
        human beings out there, which has caused the internet to become such a
        hostile place in the last ten years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because we don't have the ability to comprehend the amount of people we
        are exposed to, we reduce them to stereotypes or archetypes in our mind.
        This is normal, just how our mind processes information, but when people
        aren't aware of this happening, it can result in really dangerous and
        harmful behavior.

        We're recreating something that's based on how we remember it but
        without thinking about why we left it behind
      </p>

        Whenever I hear people reminiscing about how they miss MySpace or some
        relic of the early 2000s, I wonder what about it that they miss. After
        all, we innovated from that point for a reason. Things like SpaceHey try
        to recreate it but forget that the reason that we ended up with
        Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, is because there was something that
        MySpace lacked: discoverability, for one, which lead to the development
        of the algorithm which is so controversial today. The problem is that
        while we want to discover each other naturally, we are connected with
        others too much to feasibly do so on our own.

        While I wasn't born early enough to experience a time when I might be
        truly overjoyed to
        <a
          href="#"
          class="audio"
          onclick="event.preventDefault(); new Audio('assets/youve-got-mail-sound.mp3').play(); youveGotMail();"
          >hear the sound of a notification</a
        >, it is a reality that I one day hope to experience. I imagine that it
        must have felt sci-fi in nature to experience that for the first time,
        being able to receive mail through the computer, from a stranger that
        you never really had to meet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the reason I think that AI has such a negative and visceral
        reaction against it is because it's exacerbating an existing issue,
        which is the amount of stuff that's not really worth paying attention
        to. Ragebait, satire, fake stories, misleading content, misinformation,
        all things that AI makes it so much easier to do. Something I have grown
        to believe more over time, and I think others too, is the need for
        curation in our own lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fifty years ago, the world was a lot more interesting because people
        were exposed to such little of it. People were forced to search for
        things they found interesting. Now, it's so easily available, which is
        both a blessing and a curse. We've never been more exposed to more and I
        think that we've been getting more docile as a result. I had a separate
        thought on this from a while ago, the idea that being bored is a good
        thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I'm optimistic about this: I think in the long run, our
        standards will increase and our taste will evolve as a reaction to this
        inundation. Because there's so much, I think that this coming generation
        is going to learn to be better at learning what they value and what they
        want to spend time on. TikTok is relatively new, only about five years,
        and I think already people are realizing that they're not comfortable
        with how much time that they're spending on these apps. That while we
        have the ability to share and create each and every thing we find, that
        we maybe shouldn't, forcing us to think about what we value and are
        interested in and eventually, pushing everyone to become a curator.
